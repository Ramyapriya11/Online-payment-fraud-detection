# Online-payment-fraud-detection
Developed a model to detect online payment fraud.

An online payment fraud detection model employs machine learning to identify fraudulent and legitimate online transactions. Trained on a dataset of labeled transactions, the model learns patterns indicative of fraud, enabling it to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent activities. Numerical features are extracted from transaction data, possibly including transaction amount, location, device information, etc. Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting are commonly used for training. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Once fine-tuned, the model is deployed to real-time payment systems, where it automatically flags suspicious transactions, helping prevent unauthorized financial losses. Ongoing monitoring and updates ensure its adaptability to evolving fraud tactics, enhancing the security of online transactions.
